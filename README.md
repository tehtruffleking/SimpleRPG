This is a small project where I am following along with the PyGame tutorial from [here](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-rpg-game-tutorial/), but I am breaking up the monolith file into a modularized format.
The point is to familiarize myself with PyGame and better learn and understand Git, GitHub, PyCharm, and software development/orghanization good practices as well as leverage generative AI tools in a thoughtful way.
This is not necessarily meant for people to use or run and the changes are my own or were made in conjunction with online resources and generative AI consultation.
The original code from the link above is contained within tutorial_main.py, where I keep things exactly as they did it as a reference point.
I'll be updating this here and there as I make my way through the tutorial.
